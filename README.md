# News-App
 For Developing Web App I have used the following:

 - Angular4
 - BootStrap 3.6
 - Mansory
 - Some media querys for responsivenes 

 In Addition to the requiredments I would like to implement the following:

    - Google Analytics - To check in which particular category user is spending more time and fetching data according to that.
    - Filter for news category
    - Loader during service call
    - Share option for which key was there in response

Things Left

    - Time stamp - Was not able to get pattern from service response
    - Not designed footer
    - CSS left for Category label
